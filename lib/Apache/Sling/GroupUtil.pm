=head1 NAME

GroupUtil - Utility library returning strings representing Rest queries that
perform group related actions in the system.

=head1 ABSTRACT

GroupUtil perl library essentially provides the request strings needed to
interact with group functionality exposed over the system rest interfaces.

Each interaction has a setup and eval method. setup provides the request,
whilst eval interprets the response to give further information about the
result of performing the request.
