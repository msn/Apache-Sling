Apache-Sling version 0.08
=========================

Welcome to the Apache Sling library for perl. This library sets out to make it
simple to interact with the apache sling web framework from a perl application,
thus making it easier to harness the power of java and perl simultaneously!

Apache Sling is a web framework that uses a Java Content Repository, such as
Apache Jackrabbit, to store and manage content.

Sling applications use either scripts or Java servlets, selected based on
simple name conventions, to process HTTP requests in a RESTful way.

The embedded Apache Felix OSGi framework and console provide a dynamic runtime
environment, where code and content bundles can be loaded, unloaded and
reconfigured at runtime.

As the first web framework dedicated to JSR-170 Java Content Repositories,
Sling makes it very simple to implement simple applications, while providing an
enterprise-level framework for more complex applications.

See: http://sling.apache.org for more information about sling.
